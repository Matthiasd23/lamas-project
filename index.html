      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In the field of epistemic reasoning, the Aces and Eights (<a href="#ref1">Cedegao et al., 2021</a>) riddle is a compelling case study for logicians.
          The following text serves as our report on applying Kripke's reasoning to the puzzle. The puzzle consists of three players, each of which is dealt two of eight cards, 4 aces and 4 eights.
          Out of these, 2 cards are left face down and no player can see their cards but can see the ones dealt to others. Through repeated public announcements (PAs) one of the players is eventually
          able to figure out what hand they were dealt. A Kripke model is applied here, where different states represent the different possibilities of card combinations (worlds $w_i$).
          These worlds are connected via accessibility relations that visualize the players' knowledge. Through repeated PAs, the possible states can be reduced until a player knows their cards, which
          is the case if one of the players has the same (set of) cards in all words she considers possible.</p>

      <h3>Game description</h3>
      <p>
          Before we continue with the detailed game description and its rules, we first establish some common knowledge at the start of the game:
          <ul>
            <li>Every player knows the rules and follows the rules</li>
            <li>No player ever lies</li>
            <li>Every player is a perfect logical reasoner</li>
            <li>These rules are common knowledge</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      Now that this has been established, we can explain the exact procedure of the game; it starts with 3 players and 8 cards, the latter consisting of 4 aces and 4 eights.
      Next, each player is dealt 2 cards after they are shuffled of course, with the remaining two being put face down on the surface, for example, a table.
      Importantly, no player can see their own cards, but only the cards dealt to other players. In practice this would mean holding your cards in front of you with the backside towards yourself.
      Based on a predetermined order, each one of the players takes turns announcing (public announcements) whether they know the cards dealt to them or not. In our model we will change this,
      by letting all players do their public announcement at the same time. This allows the other players in the game to reason and deduce what cards they have based on what others know,
      and eventually, after repeated rounds of questioning, one of the three players would know what cards they were dealt.
      The puzzle is ingeniously constructed to require the players to use a combination of deductive logic, inference based on others' announcements, and an understanding of knowledge
      ($K_i$) —what they know about their own hand. It can be modeled using Kripke structures, which allows for the representation of possible worlds—each corresponding to a different arrangement
      of cards—and accessibility relations that encapsulate the players' knowledge about these worlds.

    <section>
        <h2 id="model">Formal Model</h2>
        <h3 id="Kripke model section">Kripke Model</h3>

        For a formal representation of the problem we use the notation as given by <a href="#ref2">Top et al., 2024</a>. For the Aces and Eights we use $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $P=\{88_1, A8_1,AA_1,88_2,A8_2,AA_2,88_3,A8_3,AA_3\}$,
        where $88_1$ means `Player 1 holds two eights', and $A8_2$ means `Player 2 holds an eight and an ace' etc.<br>
        The Kripke model is in $S5$ and formulated as follows $M=\langle S,R,V\rangle$.<br>
        Each state $s \in S$ was formulated in a sequential manner from player 1 to 3, with an "A" representing an ace and an "8" representing the 8 card.<br>
        The transitions $R$ for each player in the model connect each state for which the agent's own cards differ and the other agent's cards do not, as this is
        the only uncertainty each agent has. The relations for agent $i$ are $R_i(w,v)$ iff $V(P_j) \in v$ and $V(P_j) \in w$ with $i,j \in A$ and for all $j \neq i$,
        where $P_j$ is player $j$'s hand, e.g. $R_1(w,v)$ exists where $w=A8A8A8$ and $v=AAA8A8$ because $V(A8_2) \in w$ and $V(A8_2) \in v$, $V(A8_3) \in w$ and $V(A8_3) \in v$.<br>

        For example the state in which Player 1 received an ace and an 8 ($A8_1$), Player 2 received two aces ($AA_2$) and Player 3 received two eights ($88_3$), would be $V(A8_1)\cap V(AA_2) \cap V(88_3)=A8AA88$.<br>
        The total number of initial states was reduced by acknowledging that the card combination 8A results in exactly the same (logical) situation as A8. Therefore, all states with the combination 8A are disregarded,
        as each one is already incorporated by its A8 counterpart, so the order does not matter. This results in 19 possible states. A graph of the resulting model is shown in <a href="#initial-model">Figure 1</a>.

    </figure>


        <p><strong>Clarification Kripke Model:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li> The model is in S5, which means it is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.</li>
        <li> Reflexive edges are not drawn.</li>
        <li> Lines are drawn instead of symmetrical edges.</li>
        <li> Note that for some of the transitions around the middle (A8A8A8) state, some transitive edges have become hidden, because of a visualisation issue with the
        used Python library "networkx", which could not be easily resolved. These are the edges: $R_3(A8A8AA, A8A888), R_2(A888A8, A8AAA8), R_1(88A8A8, AAA8A8)$.</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Public Announcement</h3>
        In this problem we have two possible public announcements, one is `I know my cards!' and the other `I do not know my cards!'.
        An agent <i>i</i> can have one of the three card-combinations $88_i, A8_i$ or $AA_i$. Therefore, when an agent knows their cards, the formal notation for agent $i$
        who says `I know my cards!' is given as a disjunction of them knowing one of those cards combinations: $K_i88_i \lor K_iA8_i \lor K_iAA_i$. Agent $i$ knows he has either
        the set $AA$, $A8$ or $88$. The announcement `I do not know my cards!' for agent $i$ is given as the negation of "I know my cards!": $\neg(K_i88_i \lor K_iA8_i \lor K_iAA_i)$.
        Creating simultaneous announcements, however, can lead to unsuccessful announcements, where the announcement becomes untrue after applying the public announcement to the model.

        <h4>Informal Explanation</h4>
        Whenever all agents announce "I don't know" simultaneously, all states that do not have outgoing transitions to another state for every player should be removed,
        because those states are no longer possibilities. Why that is, we will explain with a short example (based on the example provided by <a href="#ref1">Cedegao et al., 2021</a>):
        Suppose the actual state is AAA888. In Round 1, each player has to announce "I don't know", because (as you can see in the top-right corner of <a href="#initial-model">Figure 1</a>)
        AAA888 has outgoing non-reflexive transitions for every player, which illustrates that all players cannot rule those connected states out. Therefore, when
        "I don't know" is announced, the graph is updated by every player by eliminating all states that do not have outgoing non-reflexive transitions for all players. Because,
        if one of those states had been the true state, the player with no outgoing non-reflexive transitions to that state would then have known their cards.

        <h4>Formal Implication</h4>
        Given $M$ as defined previously (in <a href="#model"> Formal Model</a>) and any state $v$ $ \in S$, if agent <i>i</i>  ($\in A$), announces "I don't know", that is
        equivalent to the following formal statement (and the subsequent equivalences):<br>

        <div>
        $$
        \begin{flalign*}
            &(M, v) \models \neg (K_iAA_i \lor K_iA8_i \lor K_i88_i) && \Leftrightarrow \text{De Morgan} &\\
            &(M, v) \models \neg K_iAA_i \land \neg K_iA8_i \land \neg K_i88_i  && \Leftrightarrow \text{Definition of "}\land\text{''} &\\
            &(M, v) \not\models K_iAA_i \text{ and } (M, v) \not\models K_iA8_i \text{ and } (M, v) \not\models K_i88_i &&
        \end{flalign*}
        $$
        </div>

        Therefore, all states $v$ $ \in S$  where $(M, v) \models K_iAA_i$ and all states $v$ $ \in S$ where $(M, v) \models K_iA8_i $ and all states $v$ $ \in S$ where
        $(M, v) \models K_i88_i$ should be considered impossible and can thus be removed from the model.<br>
        Since this rule is generalized for all agents, a simultaneous announcement where all agents announce "I don't know":  "$\neg(K_i88_i \lor K_iA8_i \lor K_iAA_i)$" could be rewritten as
        $\forall v \in S$ where $(M, v) \models K_iAA_i$ and $\forall v \in S$ where $(M, v) \models K_iA8_i $ and $\forall v \in S$ where $(M, v) \models K_i88_i$ for all agents $i \in A$,
        should be considered impossible and can thus be removed from the model.<br>

        Proposition \ref{eq:pa_dontknow} below shows a public announcement where all agents do not know their cards. <br>

        <!-- The equation is wrapped in a <div> to use block-level MathJax rendering -->
        <div id="prop-1">
        $$
        \begin{equation}
            (M, s) \models \bigwedge_{i\in A}(\neg (K_iAA_i \lor K_iA8_i \lor K_i88_i))
            \label{eq:pa_dontknow}
        \end{equation}
        $$
        </div>

        <h3>Example game</h3>
        In this section we will cover an example round. Let assume a game in which the true state is $A8A8A8$. Let's say we want to know the truth value for <br>

        <div id="prop-2">
        $$
        \begin{equation}
        (M,A8A8A8) \models [PA_1][PA_2][PA_3] K_1A8 \lor K_2A8 \lor K_3A8
        \label{eq:prop}
        \end{equation}
        $$
        </div>

        with $PA_1$ the announcement in the first round, $PA_2$ the announcement in the second round, and $PA_3$ the announcement in the third round. In the above proposition, we use a disjunction,
        as the game ends when any player knows their cards, not necessarily all of them (though that will prove to be the case in this situation).<br>
        The starting rounds will be globally explained to give insight into the development of the game and we will formally work out the third and fourth round of the game.

        <h4>Starting rounds</h4>
        Round 1 nobody knows their cards. Therefore all players will announce: "I don't know". After that announcement the Kripke model will look like
        <a href="#example-run">Figure 2</a>. In Round 2, no player, again, knows their cards. Thus, all players will announce: "I don't know once more",
        resulting in the Kripke model as shown in <a href="#example-run-1">Figure 3</a>. The developments from now on will be formally clarified in the sections below.<br>

        </figure>

        <figure id="example-run-1" style="text-align:center;">

        <figcaption style="font-size: larger;">Figure 3. The Kripke model after $PA_2$.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Round 3</h4>
        <strong>Announcement</strong> <br>
        The current Kripke model is given in <a href="#example-run-1">Figure 3</a>.  The remainder of Proposition \ref{eq:prop} that has to be calculated on this graph is: <br>
        $$
        (M,A8A8A8)\models [PA_3]K_1A8 \lor K_2A8 \lor K_3A8
        $$
        The graph shows that at this stage every agent still has outgoing non-reflexive transitions from "A8A8A8", which means they cannot rule the connected states out and
        therefore they all would announce "I don't know my cards". Thus the model should be updated based on this announcement.<br>

        <strong>Model Update</strong> <br>
        Using Proposition \ref{eq:pa_dontknow} we obtain:<br>

        $$
        PA_3: \neg (K_1AA_1 \lor K_1A8_1 \lor K_188_1) \land \neg (K_2AA_2 \lor K_2A8_2 \lor K_288_2) \land \neg (K_3AA_3 \lor K_3A8_3 \lor K_388_3)
        $$

        for the state $88A8A8$, where the following equivalences hold: <br>

        $$
        (M,88A8A8) \models \neg (K_1AA_1 \lor K_1A8_1 \lor K_188_1) \land \neg (K_2AA_2 \lor K_2A8_2 \lor K_288_2) \land \neg (K_3AA_3 \lor K_3A8_3 \lor K_388_3) \Leftrightarrow
        $$

        <div>
        \begin{align*}
            &(M,88A8A8) \models \neg (K_1AA_1 \lor K_1A8_1 \lor K_188_1) \text{ and}  &\\
            &(M,88A8A8) \models \neg (K_2AA_2 \lor K_2A8_2 \lor K_288_2) \text{ and} &\\
            &(M,88A8A8) \models \neg (K_3AA_3 \lor K_3A8_3 \lor K_388_3) \hfill \Leftrightarrow &\\
        \end{align*}
        </div>

        which results in a long list of propositions, one for each term:<br>

        <div>
        $$
        \begin{align*}
            (M,88A8A8) &\not\models K_1AA_1 \text{ and} \\
            ... \\
            (M,88A8A8) &\not\models K_388_3
        \end{align*}
        $$
        </div>

        Lets look at $(M,88A8A8) \not\models K_3A8$:<br>

        <div>
        $$
        \begin{align*}
            &(M,88A8A8) \not\models K_3A8 && \Leftrightarrow \quad \text{Definition of } K_i\varphi &\\
            &(M,t) \not\models A8_3 \text{ for all } t \text{ with } (88A8A8,t) \in R_3 && \Leftrightarrow \quad \text{Definition of } R &
        \end{align*}
        $$
        </div>

        Except for state $88A8A8$ there are no other states $t$. $88A8A8 \in V(A8_3)$ is True, which means $(M,88A8A8) \not\models K_3A8$ does not
        hold and state $88A8A8$ can be removed. Therefore, we remove any $s$ where $K_iAA_i$ or $K_iA8_i$ or $K_i88_i$ for all $i\in A$, removing the
        following states: $\{88A8A8, AAA8A8, A8A8AA, A8A888,A8AAA8,A888A8\}$. This results in the model as given in <a href="#pa3">Figure 4</a>. The remainder
        of Proposition \ref{eq:prop} now has to be calculated on this graph.

        <figure id="pa3" style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="project_images/round_4.png" alt="Kripke Model round 4" style="width:50%;">
        <figcaption style="font-size: larger;">Figure 4. The Kripke model after $PA_3$.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Round 4</h4>
        Now, at the start of Round 4, Player 1 says "I know my cards!", Player 2 says "I know my cards!" and Player 3 says "I know my cards!".
        The public announcement is again, as given in Proposition \ref{eq:pa_dontknow}, but more specifically:<br>
        $$
        (M,(A8A8A8)) \models (K_1AA_1 \lor K_1A8_1 \lor K_188_1) \land (K_2AA_2 \lor K_2A8_2 \lor K_288_2) \land (K_2AA_2 \lor K_2A8_2 \lor K_288_2)
        $$
        The fact that everyone knows their cards, and what cards they have can be very easily derived from the fact that the only remaining state
        is the true state $A8A8A8$, as visible in <a href="#pa3">Figure 4</a>. Namely the fact that this state is constructed as follows: $V(A8_1)\cap V(A8_2) \cap V(A8_3)$, thus every player holds an eight and an ace (and everyone knows, so everyone wins).

    <section>
        <h2>Riddle Implementation</h2>
        <p>For the implementation of the game, we used <code>python</code> and the graph-library <code>networkx</code> to implement the Kripke model.
        First, the game is initialized, keeping track of the card deck (a list of 4 "A"s and 4 "8"s), the players, and the cards on the table (which can be mostly disregarded in the rest of the implementation).
        Then, the cards are dealt by shuffling the deck and assigning each player two cards. The game also contains a Kripke model keeping track of the possible states the game can be in. The model is initialized exactly as shown in <a href="#initial-model">Figure 1</a>.</p>

        <p>After the players have been dealt their cards, they save the cards they can see (from the other players) by storing the regular expression (regex) version of the possible states.
        For example (using the state definition as given in <a href="#model">Formal model </a>), if Player 2 sees that Player 1 has "A8" and Player 3 has "AA", then all possible states in regex format would be: "A8..AA" (each "8A" that is seen, is saved as "A8" in this format). This format can be easily used to match with states.</p>

        <p>After the initialization of the game, four rounds are played (the maximum needed for anyone to deduce their cards), which consist of all players announcing whether they know their cards (initially always false) and checking the game for winners.
        These two actions involve the two main logical parts of the implementation:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>Announcing cards consists of two steps: a player's attempt to deduce their cards using the Kripke model and communicating their attempt.
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Deducing cards consists of comparing all states left in the graph with their own regex of possible states. If there is only one state left that matches their regex, then they know this is the correct world and they can use it to deduce their own cards. The player then knows their cards. In theory, there could also be multiple states left in which a player holds the same cards in order for a player to know their cards. However, because of our state reduction by acknowledging the cards A8 lead to the same situation as 8A, this is not possible in this application. </li>
                <li>The players communicate whether they know their cards, and if so, which cards they know they have.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Checking the game for winners stops the game if any player has announced they know their cards and then declares those players that have the winner(s). If no one has, then the Kripke model is updated based on that information. That update consists of removing all states from the model that are not reachable by everyone (excluding reflexive transitions), because those states are no longer possibilities as explained before.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Through repeated application of these steps for four rounds, a winner is always found. Since after four rounds, the correct state is always found (see <a href="#gen-dev">General Model Development</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The solver, implemented as described above, solves each possible case correctly. Below you can find the (terminal) output of an example run.</p>
        <p>In this example run, the true state is 888AAA. This was the output of the run:</p>

        <pre>
        Correct state: 888AAA
        Player 1's cards: ['8', '8']
        Player 2's cards: ['8', 'A']
        Player 3's cards: ['A', 'A']

        Round 1:
        Player 1 doesn't know their cards.
        Player 2 doesn't know their cards.
        Player 3 doesn't know their cards.
        No one knows their cards yet, playing another round.

        Round 2:
        Player 1 doesn't know their cards.
        Player 2 knows their cards: an A and an 8.
        Player 3 doesn't know their cards.
        There is a winner! The winners are: Player 2!
        </pre>

        <h3 id="gen-dev">General model development</h3>
        <p>The Kripke model develops in the same way each game. This standard development of the model is already shown in <a href="#model">Formal Model</a>, but more conveniently visualized in <a href="#gen-development">Figure 5</a>.</p>

        </figure>

        <p><a href="#gen-development">Figure 5</a> shows why a game can run for a maximum of four rounds.
            Namely, when Round 4 is reached, only one state is left. Therefore, at Round 4, everyone will always know their cards.</p>

        <h2>Discussion and Future Work</h2>
        <p>In this work, we have successfully managed to solve the Aces and Eights riddle with the help of a Kripke structure. From the 19 starting initial states, we can see how the general structure gets reduced each round to fewer states and transitions. This is facilitated by simultaneous public announcements, knowledge, and the fact that everyone has common knowledge about the rules. We do not perform any additional experiments or evaluations of the model, as the goal here has been to make a solver that utilizes pattern matching on the graphical Kripke model to deduce the states and transitions to be removed each round. The only difference we have here in our riddle from <a href="#ref2">Top et al, 2024</a> is the fact that we use simultaneous announcements.</p>

        <p>When it comes to limitations, an apparent issue lies with the <code>networkx</code> graphical models showing overlapping transitions, which overwrites the label for the transition below it (<a href="#initial-model"> Figure 1</a>). Other limitations include the very assumptions we make about every player being a perfect and truthful logician, which is not a realistic representation of potential actual gameplay. A more comprehensive model that could be used to compare data with human participants would require avenues for human-like error, which are not present in the current model as it just aims to solve the riddle.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, as opposed to the version with subsequent announcements, simultaneous announcements can lead to unsuccessful announcements (if a player knows their cards afterward). For example, a player announces in a round that they do not know their cards alongside other players, but after the combined simultaneous announcements, that player does know their hand. This means a part of what held true in the simultaneous announcements does not hold true anymore. The unsuccessful announcements did not affect the results in this model. However, this should mean that by letting everyone announce at the same time, the game might take "unnecessarily" many rounds. As a player apparently does an announcement that would not have been done if they had knowledge of other parts of the announcement. This does not occur while doing subsequent announcements, which should thus be more efficient round-wise.</p>

        <p>For future endeavors, we would like to suggest the addition of more players and cards to the puzzle and experiments comparing simultaneous versus non-simultaneous announcements and how it changes the model behavior. Another suggestion would be to incorporate errors in the agent's judgments to make the gameplay more human-like, or add Theory of Mind agents like <a href="#ref2">Top et al, 2024</a>. The model is also not fit yet for human participants, which could be an interesting adjustment to allow for experiments with human players. </p>

        <p>Lastly, when we first tried to solve the riddle (to formalize it) by hand, we got stuck. Even in practice, it was hard to play out the riddle, given the possible states and transitions at the start of each round. In retrospect, implementing the model straight away in a coded version that allowed for visualization would have helped immensely.</p>
